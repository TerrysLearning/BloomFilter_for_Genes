## DataSet 
There are three genome data that I use, and can be downloaded from [link1](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521/), [link2](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/), [link3](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/gambian_genome_variation_project/release/20200217_biallelic_SNV/).

Each data contains DNA of a great number of people, the kin-related table of first two datasets can be found from [link1](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521/README.sample_cryptic_relations), and [link2](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/20140625_related_individuals.txt). The third dataset doesn't contain the relationship information.

Download the dataset as gz files and extract as vcf format to the [data](./data) folder.
